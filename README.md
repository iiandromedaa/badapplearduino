# Bad Apple for Arduino
important !!
if you want to for whatever reason run this yourself, you will need to acquire the image sequence yourself

its gitignored because its just very large

get that here https://archive.org/details/bad_apple_is.7z and extract into a folder called badapplesrc

the program will look for badapplesrc/image_sequence/ in the root of the repository

the whole program is hard coded to write to a 4x2 group of characters on the 16x2 LCD so if you arent doing that, you'll need to modify a few things
