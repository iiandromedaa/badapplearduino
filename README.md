# Bad Apple for Arduino
important !!
if you want to for whatever reason run this yourself, you will need to acquire the image sequence yourself

its gitignored because its just very large

get that here https://archive.org/details/bad_apple_is.7z and extract into a folder called badapplesrc

the program will look for badapplesrc/image_sequence/ in the root of the repository
