# Bad Apple for Arduino

if you want to for whatever reason run this yourself, you will need to acquire the image sequence yourself

get that here https://archive.org/details/bad_apple_is.7z and extract into a folder called badapplesrc

the program will look for badapplesrc/image_sequence/ in the root of the repository
